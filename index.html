					Former Science and Technology Minister Derek Hanekom unveiled the <a href=“http://ska.ac.za/newsletter/issues/23/03.php”>first 64 antennas</a> that will make up a part of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) in front of  dignitaries from around the world. 
					</br>
					This unveiling was also accompanied by the opening of the specialized MeerKat Karoo Array Processor Building - a data center for the MeerKat Telescope. The processor is located underground in the Karoo observatory.
					</br>
					The unveiling of the antenna comes two years after South Africa won the international bid to host the bulk pof the project that will be coordinated by a number of countries around the world including Australia, several other African states that South Africa collaborated with to win the bid.
					</br>
					The SKA is set to probe the depths of the universe and look for signs of gravitational waves that have been predicted but not confirmed in the scientific community. It will also allow scientists and astrophysists to look into the history of galaxies and stars.

					<h4>Timeline</h4>
					<p>
					The project, valued to cost more than <a href=“http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_Kilometre_Array#Timeline_and_funding”>2 billion Euro (R28 billion)</a>, was conceived in 1991 with an international working group set up in 1993. The first memorandum of understanding was signed in 2000 with early development following suit. This culminated in the commencement of PrepSKA in 2008 leading to a flu design in 2012 and call to bid for countries to host the project.
					<br></br>
					South Africa won that bid in 2012 and has made significant progress in the construction of the main components of the SKA.

					<h4>Global Effects</h4>
					<p>
					Some of the main benefits that South Africa has received from hosting the bulk of the project include advancement in the fields of astronomy and physics. 
					<br>
					Rhodes University recently announced that <a href=“http://www.ru.ac.za/physicsandelectronics/latestnews/astronomystudentnumberssky-highthankstoska.html”>500 students have received funding</a> to study in astronomy related fields. The students who studying at universities and FET colleges included researchers, technicians and artisans.
